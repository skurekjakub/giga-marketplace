# The constitution folder

Read this before minting a new `<domain>/<slug>/` folder or choosing which
existing one a change belongs under.

`{{AI_DIR}}/feature-constitution/<domain>/<slug>/` holds two kinds of file. Keeping
them distinct is the load-bearing rule of this convention — they rot in
opposite ways, so they cannot share the same document.

| Class | Files | Audience | Lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Implementation artifacts** | `research.md`, `unknowns.md`, `spec.md`, `plan*.md` | The agents and people doing the build, during the build | Frozen — captures how the work was thought through |
| **Final spec** | `README.md` (mandatory) | Future agents and people reading the codebase | Evergreen — always describes the _current_ state |
| **Explainer** | `explainer.html` (mandatory, published) | The user, once the feature ships | Frozen — describes the branch as it landed |

`README.md` and `explainer.html` are the mandatory artifacts. The
implementation artifacts are committed when their phase ran and absent when
the phase was skipped or done conversationally — that is expected, not a bug.

`<slug>` is kebab-case and descriptive (`schema-validation`, `sitemap`,
`bulk-export`). No central registry of ids, no `F-NNN` numbers.

## First — does this belong under an existing constitution?

Before minting a fresh `<domain>/<slug>/`, read
`{{AI_DIR}}/feature-constitution/README.md` — it carries the domain roster and
every folder — and ask whether the work is really a _new_ feature or a change
to an existing one.

- A refactor, extraction, rename, consolidation, validation tweak, or perf
  change to an existing feature belongs under that feature's constitution —
  not a new folder. Fold the resulting state into the parent's `README.md`,
  and keep any journal artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan*.md`) under the parent's
  folder. A new folder per change proliferates near-duplicates that drift from
  the feature they modify.
- Mint a fresh `<slug>` folder only for a genuinely self-contained
  capability — a new component, surface, route, tool, or distinct subsystem
  that stands on its own.
- If unsure which existing constitution is the parent, pick the feature
  whose code the change most touches; if nothing fits, it is probably a real
  new feature.

This keeps the corpus a map of _features_, not a changelog of _edits_.

## Then — which domain?

`<domain>` is one of the domains in the roster, chosen by **what the feature
is about for a reader**, not by which directory its code lands in. A feature
whose code spans several source folders still has one subject.

The roster is deliberately short. A feature that fits none of the domains is
evidence for a new one — propose the domain alongside the feature, and add it
to the roster in the same branch. Never open a `misc/`.

Adding a folder means adding its row to the roster in
`{{AI_DIR}}/feature-constitution/README.md`, in the same commit. An index that
misses a folder is worse than no index, because it is read as complete.

## Cross-referencing another constitution

Write `[[slug]]`, never a path. Slugs are unique across all domains, so a name
resolves without one, and a constitution that moves domain breaks no link. A
relative path encodes a directory depth that a regroup invalidates silently;
`[[slug]]` encodes only identity.

Paths remain correct for locators outside the corpus — `docs/conventions/*`,
a source module, a test file.

## Implementation artifacts — what they may contain

Allowed and expected in `research.md`, `unknowns.md`, `spec.md`, `plan*.md`:

- Branch names, commit SHAs, PR numbers.
- Task lists, checkboxes, "Track A / B / C" framing.
- Status markers like `[x] shipped`, `<details>` collapses for done work.
- References to specific past discussions, audits, alternatives considered,
  dead ends explored.
- "Pre-correction the audit thought X" — useful context for the agent doing
  the work, captures why a decision was made.
- Self-references like "see Task 4 below".

These files are a journal of how the work got done. They stay on disk because
deleting institutional knowledge is bad, not because anyone should be reading
them by default a year from now.
