# Validation Checklist

Use this checklist during Phase 6. Check every item. Failures must be fixed before the agent family is considered complete.

# Validation Report: {Agent Family Name}

## 1. Template Rendering

- [ ] All `.agent.md` files render without Liquid errors
- [ ] All `{% render %}` references resolve to existing partials
- [ ] All `{% section %}` / `{% endsection %}` tags are balanced
- [ ] Liquid conditionals (`{% if %}`, `{% unless %}`) are syntactically correct
- [ ] Template integration tests pass (if available)

## 2. Configuration

- [ ] `profile.json` is valid JSON
- [ ] `profile.json` references correct agent files in stage pipeline
- [ ] All agents in `profile.json` stages exist as `.agent.md` files
- [ ] MCP server declarations reference existing server manifests
- [ ] Match rules are specific enough to avoid false matches with other profiles

## 3. Orchestrator Purity

- [ ] Orchestrator never reads `output.md` from any subagent
- [ ] Orchestrator never relays artifact content between subagents
- [ ] Orchestrator only reads `status.json` for routing decisions
- [ ] Orchestrator doesn't perform substantive work (research, writing, review, coding)
- [ ] All orchestrator duties are administrative: git, PR, JIRA transitions, exit block, dispatch

## 4. Routing Table Completeness

- [ ] Every subagent's every declared result code appears in the routing table
- [ ] Every routing table row has a clear next action
- [ ] No result code leads to an undefined state or hang
- [ ] Iteration limits are explicit with numeric max bounds
- [ ] Error/blocked/failed paths lead to graceful exits
- [ ] The `Any subagent | failed` catch-all row exists

## 5. Artifact Contract

- [ ] Every subagent writes `status.json` (on both success and failure)
- [ ] Every subagent appends to `manifest.json`
- [ ] Every subagent returns a one-line status message (not full artifact content)
- [ ] Artifact directory structure matches the architecture document
- [ ] Versioned artifact naming (`output-v{N}.md`) used for iterating agents

## 6. Data Flow

- [ ] Every file a subagent reads is written by another subagent (or is an external input)
- [ ] No subagent depends on data only available in the orchestrator's conversation context
- [ ] No circular read dependencies exist (A reads B's output, B reads A's output simultaneously)
- [ ] Subagents that read from iterating agents reference the correct version pattern

## 7. Ordering Constraints

- [ ] Every hard dependency in the routing table is covered by an ordering constraint
- [ ] Ordering constraints only contain subagents that exist in the roster
- [ ] No ordering constraint contradicts the routing table (e.g., "A before B" but B is dispatched first)

## 8. Subagent Completeness

- [ ] Every subagent in the orchestrator's roster has a corresponding `.agent.md` file
- [ ] Every agent in the frontmatter `agents:` list matches the file naming convention
- [ ] Every subagent declares input artifacts, output artifacts, and result codes
- [ ] Every subagent's result codes match what the orchestrator's routing table expects
- [ ] Subagent prompts reference the artifact contract partial (or equivalent inline contract)

## 9. Skill References

- [ ] Every skill referenced in agent templates or workflow skills exists in `.github/skills/`
- [ ] Skill descriptions accurately describe their trigger conditions
- [ ] Skill mount lists in the architecture match what's configured in profile/agent setup

## 10. Error Handling

- [ ] Every subagent has at least a `failed` result code
- [ ] The orchestrator handles every failure gracefully (no silent drops)
- [ ] Max iteration limits prevent infinite loops
- [ ] Blocked/error exits produce meaningful status messages

## 11. Large Artifact Handling

- [ ] Every subagent that can produce artifacts >5KB uses bash heredoc append (or equivalent multi-call write)
- [ ] Append patterns split at natural boundaries (scenes, sections, array groups), not mid-content
- [ ] JSON artifacts include a post-write validation step (`python3 -c "import json; json.load(open(...))"`)
- [ ] Growing artifacts (memory files, inventories that accumulate across runs) have size-aware strategies for chapter 4+
- [ ] No agent re-reads the same large file multiple times per run without justification (recency bias strategy)
- [ ] Read-side mitigations are documented for agents consuming >50KB of input

## 12. Todolist-Driven Workflow

- [ ] Every worker subagent (writers, editors, analysts, cataloguers) has a "Work Process" section with todolist-driven passes
- [ ] Each pass has a single concern — no multi-purpose "do everything" steps
- [ ] Passes are connected by todo-dependencies (each depends on the previous)
- [ ] Priming/reading passes come before the work passes that need those references
- [ ] Self-audit pass exists before the final output pass
- [ ] Output pass (write artifacts + status.json) is always the last todo
- [ ] Pure routers/orchestrators do NOT have todolist-driven passes (they dispatch, not process)
