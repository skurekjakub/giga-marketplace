description: "Structured planning methodology for complex multi-file feature work. Decomposes a feature into phase specification files (detailed design per phase) and a task-graph JSON (discrete, ordered, dependency-tracked tasks with acceptance criteria). Use this skill whenever planning work that spans 5+ files, involves multiple agents or components, requires phased rollout, or needs an explicit execution order. Also use when the user says 'plan this', 'make a task graph', 'break this down into phases', or 'create an implementation plan'."

# Feature Task Planning

A two-artifact planning methodology that separates *design* (phase specs) from *execution tracking* (task graph). The combination gives you detailed reasoning about each phase plus a machine-parseable, dependency-aware execution plan.

## When to Use This

- Feature spans 5+ files or touches multiple subsystems
- Work has natural phases (foundation → core → integration → docs)
- Tasks have dependencies that constrain execution order
- You need crash-resumable progress tracking (task statuses)
- Multiple people (or future-you) need to understand the plan

Don't use this for quick single-file changes or exploratory work.

## Artifact Pair

| Artifact | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Phase specs | `plans/<feature>/phase-N-<name>-v<V>.md` | Deep design: rationale, code snippets, schemas, edge cases, acceptance criteria |
| Task graph | `plans/<feature>/task-graph-<family>-v<V>.json` | Flat task list with IDs, prerequisites, targets, status tracking, execution order |

The phase specs are the *why and how*. The task graph is the *what and when*.

**Both artifacts are versioned.** Every modification to the plan produces a new file — never edit a previous version in place. See [Plan Versioning](#plan-versioning) below.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope Discovery

Before writing anything, gather enough context to define phases. Interview the user or analyze the codebase:

1. **What's the goal?** One sentence describing the end state.
2. **What exists today?** Read the files/systems that will be modified.
3. **What are the subsystems?** Group changes by area (infra, core logic, integration, docs).
4. **What are the dependencies?** Which changes must land before others?
5. **What are the constraints?** Backward compatibility, no new agents, performance budget, etc.

Write a brief `plans/<feature>/overview.md` if the feature is complex enough to warrant a high-level summary separate from the phases.

### Step 2: Phase Decomposition

Split the work into numbered phases. Each phase should be:
- **Independently comprehensible** — a reader can understand Phase 3 without reading Phase 2
- **Dependency-ordered** — Phase N's outputs are consumed by Phase N+1 (mostly)
- **Testable** — you can verify that a phase is correctly implemented

The typical phase progression (adapt as needed):

| Phase | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation / Infrastructure | Bootstrap scripts, directory scaffolds, seed files |
| 2–N | Core feature work | New components, modified components, integration wiring |
| N+1 | Cross-cutting concerns | Invariant rollout, schema extensions, shared patterns |
| N+2 | Documentation | Guide updates, architecture doc updates, header comments |
| N+3 | Verification | End-to-end consistency checks |

### Step 3: Write Phase Specs

For each phase, create `plans/<feature>/phase-N-<name>-v1.md` following this structure:

```markdown
# Phase N: <Name>

**Goal**: One sentence.
**Dependencies**: Which phases must be complete first.
**Outputs consumed by**: Which later phases use this phase's outputs.

## Tasks

### N.1 — <Task Title>

**File**: `path/to/target`

<Rationale — why this change is needed>

**Changes**:

1. <Specific change with code snippets, schemas, or examples>
2. ...

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### N.2 — <Task Title>
...
```

Phase spec guidelines:
- Include actual code snippets, JSON schemas, and file paths — not vague descriptions
- Document design decisions and their rationale inline (or in a `designDecisions` block)
- Call out edge cases: what happens when X is missing, what's the failure mode, what's the fallback
- Cross-reference other phases when tasks produce artifacts consumed downstream
- Keep each phase spec self-contained enough that an implementer can work from it alone

### Step 4: Build the Task Graph

After all phase specs are written, create `plans/<feature>/task-graph-<family>-v1.json`. This is a structured JSON file that flattens all phase tasks into a single ordered list with explicit dependencies. The `version` field in the JSON header must match the file suffix (v1 → `"version": 1`).

Read `references/task-graph-schema.md` for the complete JSON schema. Key principles:

1. **Every task has a unique ID** — use a prefix + sequential number (e.g., `M-001`, `D-001`, `O-001`)
2. **Every task references its phase spec** — `ref` field points to the section (e.g., `phase-3-research-scout.md § 3.1`)
3. **Prerequisites are explicit** — `prerequisites` array lists task IDs that must complete first
4. **Acceptance criteria are concrete** — verifiable statements, not vague goals
5. **Execution order is derived** — the `executionOrder` block groups tasks into steps, noting which can run in parallel

The task graph header includes metadata: version, family name, description, summary counts, assumptions, and (optionally) design decisions. The `summary` block gives a quick overview of scope (total tasks, phases, new files, modified files).

### Step 5: Debrief & Refinement Loop

After producing the phase specs + task graph, present the plan to the user for review. This is the critical quality gate — the plan should be scrutinized before any implementation begins.

Present:
1. **Executive summary** — total tasks, phases, key design decisions
2. **Phase-by-phase walkthrough** — one paragraph per phase summarizing what it does and why
3. **Dependency highlights** — any non-obvious ordering constraints
4. **Risk areas** — phases or tasks that are complex, uncertain, or have broad blast radius
5. **Open questions** — anything you're unsure about

Then use `ask_questions` to collect feedback. Always include these questions (adapt wording to context):
- "Does this phasing make sense? Should any phases be split or merged?"
- "Are there missing tasks or unnecessary ones?"
- "Do the design decisions align with your intent?"
- "Any constraints I missed?"

Iterate until the user approves. Each iteration:
1. Edit the current phase specs and task graph **in place** — these are still drafts under active review
2. Re-present the updated plan, noting what changed from the previous iteration
3. Use `ask_questions` again to collect the next round of feedback

Always use `ask_questions` for the debrief — never just print questions inline. This ensures the user gets a structured prompt they can respond to.

The debrief loop operates on the current version. No version bump occurs until the user approves — the draft is mutable while under review.

Once the user explicitly approves the plan, the current files become the approved baseline (v1). **Only then** does the versioning clock start — subsequent changes (mid-implementation discoveries, status updates) create new versions. Do not begin implementation until approved.

### Step 6: Implementation

Execute tasks in the order specified by `executionOrder.steps`. For each step:

1. Mark the task(s) as `in-progress` in a todo list
2. Read the corresponding phase spec section for detailed implementation guidance
3. Implement the changes
4. Verify against acceptance criteria
5. Mark the task as `completed`

After each phase completes, do a brief checkpoint with the user if the feature is large.

When all tasks are complete, create a final version of the task graph with all statuses set to `"implemented"` and add `implementedAt` and `implementationStatus: "complete"` to the header. This final version is the completion record.

If the plan changes mid-implementation (tasks added, reordered, or removed based on discoveries), create a new versioned task graph and corresponding phase specs rather than editing the approved versions. Note the reason for the mid-implementation change in the new version's `designDecisions`.

## Plan Versioning

Every modification to the plan creates new files — previous versions are never edited in place. This provides a complete audit trail of how the plan evolved through refinement and implementation.

### Naming Convention

```
plans/<feature>/
  phase-1-foundation-v1.md          ← approved baseline (edited in place during debrief)
  phase-1-foundation-v2.md          ← mid-implementation change
  phase-2-core-logic-v1.md          ← unchanged across iterations
  task-graph-manual-v1.json         ← approved baseline (edited in place during debrief)
  task-graph-manual-v2.json         ← mid-implementation change
  task-graph-manual-v3.json         ← final (all tasks implemented)
```

### Rules

1. **File suffix matches JSON `version` field** — `task-graph-manual-v3.json` has `"version": 3`
2. **Phase spec `ref` fields track versions** — `"ref": "phase-2-core-logic-v1.md § 2.1"`
3. **Only the highest-numbered version is active** — earlier versions are frozen history
4. **Unchanged files keep their version** — if Phase 3 spec is untouched across three task graph iterations, it stays at v1. Don't create empty version bumps.
5. **Each new version carries a `versionNote`** — one line in the task graph header explaining what changed (e.g., `"versionNote": "Added D-018 per user feedback on conflict resolution"`)

### When to Create a New Version

| Trigger | New task graph version? | New phase spec version? |
|---|---|---|
| Debrief feedback (pre-approval) | No — edit v1 in place | No — edit v1 in place |
| Mid-implementation plan change | Yes | Only for affected phases |
| Task status updates only (in-progress → implemented) | Yes | No |
| All tasks complete (final) | Yes | No |

## Splitting Into Multiple Task Graphs

For very large features, split into multiple task graph files in the same `plans/<feature>/` directory:

- `task-graph-manual-v1.json` — changes applied directly (e.g., editing agent files)
- `task-graph-orchestrator-v1.json` — changes requiring orchestrator infrastructure
- `task-graph-<variant>-v1.json` — any other logical grouping

Each graph is independently versioned and can reference the same phase specs. Document the split rationale in an `overview.md` or `dual-family-architecture.md` file.

## Status Lifecycle

Task statuses track progress:

```
not-started → in-progress → implemented
                          → blocked (with reason)
                          → deferred (moved to follow-up)
```

Status changes produce a new task graph version. The final version has graph-level completion markers:
```json
{
  "version": 4,
  "versionNote": "All tasks implemented — final",
  "implementationStatus": "complete",
  "implementedAt": "2026-03-13"
}
```

## Tips

- **Phase specs are the source of truth for design**; the task graph is the source of truth for execution order and status.
- **Err toward more tasks, not fewer.** A task that touches 3 files is fine. A task that touches 15 files should be split.
- **Prerequisites should be minimal.** Only list the tasks that *must* complete before this one can start. Don't chain everything linearly if tasks can run in parallel.
- **Acceptance criteria should be verifiable.** "Agent file exists with correct frontmatter" not "agent works correctly."
- **Design decisions in the task graph** are for decisions that affect the whole graph. Per-task decisions go in the phase spec.
